## Issues Identified

### ðŸŸ¡ MINOR: TypeScript Module System Inconsistency

**File:** `tsconfig.json:4`  
**Issue:** Configuration mismatch between TypeScript settings and import statements

**Details:**
- TypeScript config uses `"module": "commonjs"` 
- Source files use ES module imports (`.js` extensions)
- This creates inconsistency but doesn't break functionality

**Risk Level:** Low  
**Impact:** No runtime issues, but may cause confusion for developers

**Recommended Fix:**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ES2022",  // Change from "commonjs"
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "sourceMap": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```
