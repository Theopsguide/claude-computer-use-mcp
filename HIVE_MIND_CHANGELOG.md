## Changes Made

### ðŸ”§ TypeScript Configuration Fix

**File:** `tsconfig.json`  
**Change:** Updated module system configuration for consistency

**Before:**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    ...
  }
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ES2022",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "lib": ["ES2022"],
    ...
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Aligns TypeScript configuration with ES module imports used throughout the codebase
- Adds explicit `moduleResolution: "node"` for better module resolution
- Maintains consistency between configuration and actual usage
- No breaking changes to functionality
