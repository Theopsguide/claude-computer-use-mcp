# 🎭 Complete Claude Computer Use MCP Setup Guide

## 🎉 **SUCCESS: MCP Server is Working!**

Claude successfully detected and attempted to use the browser automation tools. The only remaining step is installing the system dependencies for Playwright.

---

## ✅ **Current Status:**
- ✅ **Claude Desktop**: MCP server configured and active
- ✅ **Claude Code**: MCP server configured and active  
- ✅ **Playwright**: Browser binaries downloaded
- ⚠️ **System Dependencies**: Need manual installation

---

## 🔧 **FINAL SETUP STEP: Install System Dependencies**

You need to run this **ONE TIME** in a terminal with sudo access:

### **Step 1: Open WSL Terminal**
- Open Windows Terminal
- Select "Ubuntu" or your WSL distribution
- Navigate to the project directory

### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd /home/luke/claude-computer-use-mcp

# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install core dependencies (required)
sudo apt-get install -y libnspr4 libnss3

# Install additional browser dependencies (recommended)
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libatk-bridge2.0-0 \
  libdrm2 \
  libgtk-3-0 \
  libgbm1 \
  libasound2 \
  libxss1 \
  libgconf-2-4

# Alternative: Use Playwright's auto-installer
sudo npx playwright install-deps chromium
```

### **Step 3: Test Installation**
```bash
# Quick test
node -e "const { chromium } = require('playwright'); (async () => { const browser = await chromium.launch(); console.log('✅ Success!'); await browser.close(); })();"
```

---

## 🚀 **After Installing Dependencies**

### **Test Browser Automation**
Ask Claude in **Claude Desktop**:
```
"Launch a browser and take a screenshot of google.com"
```

**Expected Response:**
- Claude will launch a browser
- Navigate to google.com  
- Capture and return a screenshot
- Provide session details

---

## 🛠️ **Alternative: Windows Installation**

If WSL dependencies are problematic, install on Windows:

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
npm install -g playwright
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright install-deps chromium

# Update Claude Desktop config to use Windows path
# Edit: C:\Users\Luke\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

## 🎯 **Available Browser Automation Tools**

Once setup is complete, you can use:

### **Basic Commands:**
- `"Launch a browser and navigate to [URL]"`
- `"Take a screenshot of the current page"`
- `"Click on [element description]"`
- `"Type '[text]' into the search box"`
- `"Extract all links from the page"`

### **Advanced Commands:**
- `"Fill out the contact form with my information"`
- `"Navigate through multiple pages and collect data"`
- `"Take screenshots of different sections"`
- `"Wait for a specific element to appear"`

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: Dependencies still missing**
```bash
# Try alternative package names
sudo apt-get install -y \
  libnss3-dev \
  libatk-bridge2.0-dev \
  libcups2-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev
```

### **Problem: Permission errors**
```bash
# Fix Playwright cache permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.cache/ms-playwright/
chmod +x ~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-*/chrome-linux/chrome
```

### **Problem: Claude still can't launch browser**
1. Check Claude Desktop logs: `C:\Users\Luke\AppData\Roaming\Claude\logs\mcp.log`
2. Restart Claude Desktop completely
3. Verify MCP server is running: Ask Claude "What tools do you have access to?"

When working correctly:
- ✅ Claude responds with browser session creation
- ✅ Screenshots are captured and displayed
- ✅ Browser navigation works smoothly
- ✅ No error messages about missing dependencies
